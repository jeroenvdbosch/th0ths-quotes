== DESCRIPTION ==
*th0th's Quotes* is a wordpress widget plugin which shows a random quote when page is loaded. There was a plugin doing the same exact thing but it was using AJAX and I don't like it :) Also that plugin didn't seem like it is still being maintained. Feature requests are welcome -and it would be better if you send your patches with feature requests :P-.

== INSTALLATION ==
Plugin is not listed in Wordpress' plugin directory -at least for now-. You can simply checkout from git for the most recent version or you can unzip the zip file if it is what you have (in your wp-content/plugins/ directory of course).

== CONTACT ==
You can e-mail me about your thoughts, comments or patches.
